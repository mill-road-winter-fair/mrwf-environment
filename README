Test environment for Mill Road Winter Fair site development
===========================================================

Requirements:

- vagrant
- mrwf-ss git project

This environment will eventually allow you to start up a virtual machine which runs a test version of the mill road winter fair website (live version millroadwinterfair.org)

Currently we're trying to find all the required plugins.

To get started, make a file called vagrant.yml in config using vagrant.yml.example as a template. To start the vm and get the provisioning going run the following command in the root project directory:

vagrant up --provision
